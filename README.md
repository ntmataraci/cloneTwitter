live demo :https://clonetwitter-chi.vercel.app/home

note : it has not fully responsive for mobile phones. But theme is changed with screen width for small windows.

It's basic native twitter clone with nextjs ( actually I dont use any nextjs lib like Img or Link )

- You can send tweet. (only on browser)
